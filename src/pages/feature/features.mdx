| Decentralized data                      |    User's data are stored outside of the application and user controls its access permission from the applications    | <IconNo/> | <IconNo/> |    <IconYes/>    |
| Interoperability                        |    One agent can interoperate with any others even it is not developed by a same developer    | limited to agents developed by a same developer and need to call API manually | limited to agents developed by a same developer and need to call API manually | <IconYes/> |
| Multi-agent collaboration               |    Has standard collaborating mechanism between User, System and Agents    | No standard mechanism and need to communicate case by case, also limited to a same developer | No standard mechanism and need to communicate case by case, also limited to a same developer | <IconYes/> |
| Function/Agent-level sand-boxing        |    Every agent and even a function can be isolated so that multi agents come from different can be running in a same memory environment safely    | <IconNo/> | <IconNo/> | <IconYes/> |
| Conversational computing                | Code can talk to user, system or other agents to ask more information at any function location, the agent will be paused and continue to run when got response. | <IconNo/> | <IconNo/> | <IconYes/> |
| Logic-abstraction                       | We re-organized the whole program to make developers focused on logic of busniess and forget about the hardware, data and programing language abstraction. | <IconNo/> | <IconNo/> | <IconYes/> |
| Visual graph editing                    | We build a graph interaction which is as simple as Houdini and as powerful as any turning completed programming language. | <IconNo/> | <IconNo/> | <IconYes/> |
| Agent format standard               | We defined a agent format standard to represent a turing completed agent program which can be loaded and runned dynamically so everyone can develop an agent to handle personal needs. | some runtime in-memory agent object | some runtime in-memory agent object | <IconYes/> |
| Virtual machine & Dynamical loading and running | Can load and run dynamically | <IconNo/> | <IconYes/> | <IconYes/> |
